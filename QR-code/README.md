## My process

I just tested manually everything in HTML and CSS untill it fits the exact discription of the designs provided.

### What I learned

This is quite a simple project but still I learned how to create a footer, JPEG files are also editable with CSS for example I used border radius for the rounded edges on <img>tag.
